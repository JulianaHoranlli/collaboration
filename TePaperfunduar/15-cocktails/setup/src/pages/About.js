    A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing,
     typically composed of several sentences, 
     that focuses on a single idea or topic. 
     It serves as a building block of larger texts, 
     helping to organize and structure information for 
     better readability. Paragraphs usually begin with an
      indentation or line break, signaling a shift in topic 
      or a new point being made.
